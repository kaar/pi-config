## Tools
- **CRITICAL**: NEVER use sed/cat to read a file or a range of a file. Always use the read tool.
- Use `gh pr diff` to get git diffs for PRs when reviewing.
- When reading a file in full, do not use `offset` or `limit`.
- Use `rg` (ripgrep) instead of `grep` for searching.

## Behavior
- Do NOT start implementing, designing, or modifying code unless explicitly asked
- When user mentions an issue or topic, just summarize/discuss it - don't jump into action
- Wait for explicit instructions like "implement this", "fix this", "create this"
- When drafting content for files (blog posts, documentation, etc.), apply changes directly without asking for confirmation

## Writing Style
- NEVER use em dashes (—), en dashes, or hyphens surrounded by spaces as sentence interrupters
- Restructure sentences instead: use periods, commas, or parentheses
- No flowery language, no "I'd be happy to", no "Great question!"
- No paragraph intros like "The punchline:", "The kicker:", "Here's the thing:", "Bottom line:" - these are LLM slop
- Be direct and technical

## Style
- Keep answers short and concise
- No emojis in commits, issues, PR comments, or code
- No fluff or cheerful filler text
- Technical prose only, be kind but direct (e.g., "Thanks @user" not "Thanks so much @user!")

## Path Resolution in Extensions
- When writing extensions that operate on file paths, assume paths may contain symlinks. Resolve them with `realpathSync` (or equivalent) before comparing paths or passing them to tools like git or file watchers. A path that looks correct can silently fail if a symlink component is not resolved.

## **CRITICAL** Tool Usage Rules **CRITICAL**
- NEVER use sed/cat to read a file or a range of a file. Always use the read tool (use offset + limit for ranged reads).
- You MUST read every file you modify in full before editing.

## **CRITICAL** Git Rules for Parallel Agents **CRITICAL**

Multiple agents may work on different files in the same worktree simultaneously. You MUST follow these rules:

### Committing
- **ONLY commit files YOU changed in THIS session**
- ALWAYS include `fixes #<number>` or `closes #<number>` in the commit message when there is a related issue or PR
- NEVER use `git add -A` or `git add .` - these sweep up changes from other agents
- ALWAYS use `git add <specific-file-paths>` listing only files you modified
- Before committing, run `git status` and verify you are only staging YOUR files
- Track which files you created/modified/deleted during the session

### Forbidden Git Operations
These commands can destroy other agents' work:
- `git reset --hard` - destroys uncommitted changes
- `git checkout .` - destroys uncommitted changes
- `git clean -fd` - deletes untracked files
- `git stash` - stashes ALL changes including other agents' work
- `git add -A` / `git add .` - stages other agents' uncommitted work
- `git commit --no-verify` - bypasses required checks and is never allowed
